A Level Project NEA
Hello!
This is the project I created for the non-exam assessment section of my computer science A Level.
It was created in October 2020 and completed in March 2021 and I received a grade A.
Unfortunatly the final page isn't the completed version due to me finishing school and losing the latest versions of all my school files. :(
However all testing has been documented in Project.docx!
